I’m an [UX Engineer](https://lt.linkedin.com/in/irasikaite/) from Lithuania, with a passion for design and technology, building thoughtful, performant, and user-first digital products.

I thrive at the intersection of product and engineering — turning real user needs into intuitive, scalable features. I’m passionate about delivering not just clean code, but real impact: higher engagement, better retention, and delighted users.

Over the years, I’ve led feature development from idea to launch, collaborated deeply with product managers and designers, and consistently brought a product mindset to frontend work — whether through shaping the user experience, experimenting with solutions, or improving core flows.

For the past 15+ years, I have worked at both small startups and large companies like [Vinted](https://www.vinted.com/), [1stDibs](https://www.1stdibs.com/), [Treatwell](https://www.treatwell.co.uk/) and [Argyle](https://www.argyle.com/), where I not only led the development of key business features but also served as Design System field leader :rocket:.

Now, I’m evolving into a Product Engineer role — where my technical depth and product thinking can create even greater outcomes. I’m excited to bring my skills to the [BBright](https://bbright.lt) team, where I believe we can make a real difference in the lives of students and teachers.
