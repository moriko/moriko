Iâ€™m an [UX Engineer](https://lt.linkedin.com/in/irasikaite/) from Lithuania, with a passion for design and technology.

For the past 15+ years, I have worked at both small startups and large companies like [Vinted](https://www.vinted.com/), [1stDibs](https://www.1stdibs.com/) and [Treatwell](https://www.treatwell.co.uk/), focusing on creating the best user experience, where I not only led the development of key business features but also served as Design System field leader :rocket:.

Currently working for [Argyle](https://www.argyle.com/) which provides global access to employment data, developing an enterprise-grade, web-based tool to test, launch, and manage payroll connectivity experiences.
